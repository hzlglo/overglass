# README

Overglass is a UI skin around Ableton, optimized for editing sets recorded from Elektron Overbridge.
It's intended to solve the following problem: Overbridge records automation as many automation parameters changing within one track, for each Elektron device. Each Elektron device might have several sub-tracks inside of it, but this is not clearly represented inside of Ableton. The parameter automation lanes aren't sorted, and 'mute' state is treated as just another parameter.

### How to use

1. Load an Ableton .als file
1. Edit automation
1. Save your edits as an edited .als file
