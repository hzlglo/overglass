- Use yarn for package management
- To understand and debug .als file structure, use the ./src/lib/parsers/exploreStructure.ts helper that you made
- Avoid code duplication. Ensure that the codebase is well-structured and modular, with separation of concerns between classes/components. Organize code into separate files wherever appropriate.
- Code is read more often than it is written, make sure your code is always optimised for readability
- Put each d3.js logical block into its own $state / $derived / $effect call
- Use context7 for more context on daisyui
